## Phase Transitions, Optimal Errors and Optimality of Message-Passing in Generalized Linear Models
by Jean Barbier, Florent Krzakala, Nicolas Macris, Léo Miolane, Lenka Zdeborová

Perceptrondemo.ipynb is a julia demo that solve the variational problem for the replica free energy for the binary Perceptron, and plot the optimal error and generalization error.

MatlabDemo contains a matlab code that runs AMP for the corresponding problem
